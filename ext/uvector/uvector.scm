;; This module defines the superset of SRFI-4, homogeneous numeric vector
;; types.   Most of basic operations are defined in the DSO module libuvector.
;; Besides defining functions, the DSO sets up a reader hook to enable
;; extended syntax such as #s8(1 2 3).
;; This module also defines methods for collection and sequence frameworks.
