;; Load path needs to be dealt with at the compile time.  this is a
;; hack to do so.   Don't modify *load-path* directly, since it causes
;; weird compiler-evaluator problem.
;; I don't like the current name "add-load-path", though---looks like
;; more a procedure than a compiler syntax---any ideas?
